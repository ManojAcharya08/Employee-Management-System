# Employee-Management-System
Employee Management System is a web app that lets you add, view, update, and delete employee records easily through a modern, user-friendly interface.

**Solution:**

- Ensure `index.html` is in `src/main/resources/templates/`
- Your controller should return `"index"` (not `"index.html"`)
- Restart your server after changes

### Static Files Not Loading

- Make sure your CSS, JS, and images are in `src/main/resources/static/`
- Reference them in HTML with a leading slash, e.g. `/style.css`, `/Picture.jpg`
